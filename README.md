# pygameRhythmGame

Rhythm Game using Pygame.

To install and use this Rhythm game, you must have the Pygame library already installed onto your interpreter. Read pygame.org for more details.

v3.0:

Complete redesign of previous attempt. The previous attempt had a lot of jumbled-up code that was hard to understand and structure.

Additions to this version:
    - Proper Judgement
    - Better Menu
    - Song selection?

Current Status: Complete restart

To Do:
- [ ] Find a better way to iterate over the list of key sprites?
- [ ] Look over old functions to find either better ways to optimize / not require them OR better ways to implement them if they are required
- [ ] Build on Key Spacing. Requires a multiplier to increase the spacing and move everything back into its original space (decrease multiplier as well).
